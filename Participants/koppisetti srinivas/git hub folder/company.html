      <h2> Air India </h2>
      <P>Air India is the flag carrier airline of India, headquartered at New Delhi. It is owned by Talace Private
         Limited,
         a Special-Purpose Vehicle (SPV) of Tata Sons, after Air India Limited's former owner, the Government of India,
         completed the sale. Air India operates a fleet of Airbus and Boeing aircraft serving 102 domestic and
         international destinations.The airline has its hub at Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi, alongside
         several focus cities across India.
         Air India is the largest international carrier out of India with an 18.6% market share. Over 60 international
         destinations are served by Air India across five continents. The airline became the 27th member of Star
         Alliance
         on 11 July 2014. The airline was founded by J. R. D. Tata as Tata Airlines in 1932; Tata himself flew its first
         single-engine de Havilland Puss Moth, carrying air mail from Karachi's Drigh Road Aerodrome to Bombay's Juhu
         aerodrome and later continuing to Madras (currently Chennai).
         After World War II, it became a public limited company and was renamed as Air India. On 21 February 1960, it
         took
         delivery of its first Boeing 707 named Gauri Shankar and became the first Asian airline to induct a jet
         aircraft
         in its fleet.[13] In 2500 2501, attempts were made to privatise Air India and from 2506 onwards, it suffered
         losses
         after its merger with Indian Airlines. Another privatisation attempt was launched in 2017, which concluded with
         ownership of the airline and associated properties reverting to Tata in 2022.
